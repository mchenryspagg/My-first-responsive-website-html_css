      <h3>Goal for the Altschool Diploma Course:</h3> <br>  
      <i>"The ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with effort"</i>
      <br><br>
    <p> My goal for the Altschool diploma course is to gain the requisite skillset that will propel me in my journey to being a world class developer.
        I intend to become skilled in the usage of frontend development tools, and be ready to compete on 
        a global stage by the end of December 2022. I also intend to learn and master python programming 
        language and add that to my skillset.
        The goal is to earn my Altschool certificate, network and collaborate with other developers, and complete numerous projects 
        during the said period that would help boast my portfolio, and subsequently secure an internship, a remote job or kick-start freelancing by the end of December 2022.
